# Beta Version 2.11.0

## Added

* Added these ValueSchedulers under the "ValueSchedulers" section:

  * Chained
	
	* Constant
	
	* CosineAnnealing
	
	* Exponential
	
	* InverseSquareRoot
	
	* InverseTime
	
	* Linear
	
	* MultipleStep
	
	* Multiplicative
	
	* Polynomial
	
	* Sequential

	* Step

## Changes

* ValueSchedulers can now be used in place of Optimizers for scheduling learning rate.

* The calculate() function now accepts ModelParameters as the third parameter for all the optimizers under the "Optimizers" section.

## Fixes

* Fixed a bug from AdaptiveMomentEstimation nder the "Optimizers" section.

## Removed

* Removed TimeDecay and StepDecay from the "ValueSchedulers" section.

* Removed LearningRateStepDecay and LearningRateTimeDecay from the "Optimizers" section.
