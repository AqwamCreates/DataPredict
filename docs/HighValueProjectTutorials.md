* The "minimal implementation time" assumes that a junior gameplay machine learning engineer is handling the implementation.

* Since DataPredict is written in native Lua, you can have extra compute per player alongside a single Roblox server by loading the models on players' Roblox client.

  * Phone users: Likely have 4 GB - 8 GB RAM. Variable CPU.
 
  * PC users: Likely have 8 GB - 16 GB RAM. Variable CPU.
