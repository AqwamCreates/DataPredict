# Release Version 2.9

## Models

* MeanShift now accepts table of matrices instead of a single matrix.

* ExpectationMaximization now have "mode" and "distanceFunction" parameters in its constructor.

* Fixed some bugs and optimized these models:

  * AgglomerativeHierarchical
 
  * ExpecationMaximization

  * KMeans
 
  * KMedoids
 
  * MeanShift

* Removed redundant codes from these models:

  * ExpecationMaximization

  * KMeans
 
  * KMedoids
 
  * MeanShift

  * GaussianNaiveBayes
 
  * MultinomialNaiveBayes
 
  * BernoulliNaiveBayes
 
  * ComplementNaiveBayes
 
  * CategoricalNaiveBayes
