# Release Version 2.11

## ValueSchedulers

* Added these value schedulers:

	* Chained
	
	* Constant
	
	* CosineAnnealing
	
	* Exponential
	
	* InverseSquareRoot
	
	* InverseTime
	
	* Linear
	
	* MultipleStep
	
	* Multiplicative
	
	* Polynomial
	
	* Sequential

	* Step

* ValueSchedulers can now be used in place of Optimizers for scheduling learning rate.

* Removed TimeDecay and StepDecay from the "ValueSchedulers" section.

## Optimizers

* Added these optimizers:

	* ResilientBackwardPropagation

 	* AdaptiveFactor

	* AdaptiveMomentEstimationWeightDecay

 	* RectifiedAdaptiveMomentEstimation 

* The calculate() function now accepts ModelParameters as the third parameter for all the optimizers.

* Renamed AdaptiveGradientDelta to AdaptiveDelta. 

* The Optimizers' "internalParameterArray" value are now set to nil instead of an empty table when calling the new() constructor and reset() function.

* Removed LearningRateStepDecay and LearningRateTimeDecay.

* Fixed some bugs in AdaptiveMomentEstimation and NesterovAcceleratedAdaptiveMomentEstimation.

## Models

* Added these tabular reinforcement learning models:

	* TabularClippedDoubleQLearning

	* TabularDoubleQLearningV1

	* TabularDoubleQLearningV2

	* TabularDoubleStateActionRewardStateActionV1

	* TabularDoubleStateActionRewardStateActionV2

	* TabularDoubleExpectedStateActionRewardStateActionV1

	* TabularDoubleExpectedStateActionRewardStateActionV2

* All tabular reinforcement learning models can now be used inside CategoricalPolicy quick setup. 

* TabularReinforcementLearningBaseModel's new() constructor now accepts "Optimizer" as one of its parameters.

* TabularQLearning, TabularStateActionRewardStateAction and TabularExpectedStateActionRewardStateAction uses EligibilityTrace object instead of "lambda" numerical value.

* Added OneVsOne.

* Made some internal code changes to DeepDoubleQLearningV2, DeepDoubleStateActionRewardStateActionV2 and DeepDoubleExpectedStateActionRewardStateActionV2 models under the "Optimizers" section.

* Made the default value for "averagingRate" parameter for DeepDoubleQLearningV2, DeepDoubleStateActionRewardStateActionV2 and DeepDoubleExpectedStateActionRewardStateActionV2 models to 0.01 instead of 0.995 under the "Optimizers" section.

* Optimized NeuralNetwork code so that the activation function calculation is not performed for bias values under the "Models" section.

## EligibilityTraces

* BaseEligibilityTrace's new() constructor function now accepts "mode" as one of its parameters under the "EligibilityTrace" section.

* Added "stateIndex" parameter as the first parameter for BaseEligibilityTrace's incrementFunction() under the "EligibilityTrace" section.

* Fixed some bugs where the BaseEligibilityTrace returns an "Unknown" class name.

## QuickSetup

* Added "StableSoftmaxSampling" and "StableBoltzmannSampling" options to the CategoricalPolicy.

* Fixed some bugs in CategoricalPolicy.

## Others

* Removed StringSplitter and Tokenizer from the "Others" section.

## Regularizers

* Fixed some bugs where the BaseRegularizer returns an "Unknown" class name.
