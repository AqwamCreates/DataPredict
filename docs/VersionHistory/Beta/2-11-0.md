# Beta Version 2.11.0

## Added

* Added these value schedulers under the "ValueSchedulers" section:

	* Chained
	
	* Constant
	
	* CosineAnnealing
	
	* Exponential
	
	* InverseSquareRoot
	
	* InverseTime
	
	* Linear
	
	* MultipleStep
	
	* Multiplicative
	
	* Polynomial
	
	* Sequential

	* Step

* Added these optimizers under the "Optimizers" section:

	* ResilientBackwardPropagation

 	* AdaptiveFactor

	* AdaptiveMomentEstimationWeightDecay

 	* RectifiedAdaptiveMomentEstimation 

* Added these tabular reinforcement learning models under the "Models" section:

	* TabularClippedDoubleQLearning

	* TabularDoubleQLearningV1

	* TabularDoubleQLearningV2

	* TabularDoubleStateActionRewardStateActionV1

	* TabularDoubleStateActionRewardStateActionV2

	* TabularDoubleExpectedStateActionRewardStateActionV1

	* TabularDoubleExpectedStateActionRewardStateActionV2

* Added OneVsOne under the "Others" section.

* Added "stateIndex" parameter as the first parameter for BaseEligibilityTrace's incrementFunction() under the "EligibilityTrace" section.

## Changes

* ValueSchedulers can now be used in place of Optimizers for scheduling learning rate.

* TabularReinforcementLearningBaseModel's new() constructor now accepts "Optimizer" as one of its parameters under the "Models" section.

* BaseEligibilityTrace's new() constructor function now accepts "mode" as one of its parameters under the "EligibilityTrace" section.

* TabularQLearning, TabularStateActionRewardStateAction and TabularExpectedStateActionRewardStateAction uses EligibilityTrace object instead of lambda numerical value under the "Models" section.

* The calculate() function now accepts ModelParameters as the third parameter for all the optimizers under the "Optimizers" section.

* Renamed AdaptiveGradientDelta to AdaptiveDelta under the "Optimizers" section. 

* Optimized NeuralNetwork code so that the activation function calculation is not performed for bias values under the "Models" section.

* The optimizers' internal parameters arrays are now set to nil instead of an empty table under the "Optimizers" section.

## Removed

* Removed TimeDecay and StepDecay from the "ValueSchedulers" section.

* Removed LearningRateStepDecay and LearningRateTimeDecay from the "Optimizers" section.

* Removed StringSplitter and Tokenizer from the "Others" section.

## Fixes

* Fixed some bugs in AdaptiveMomentEstimation and NesterovAcceleratedAdaptiveMomentEstimation under the "Optimizers" section.

* Fixed some bugs where BaseRegularizer and BaseEligibilityTrace returns an "Unknown" class name under the "Regularizers" and "EligibilityTraces" sections.
