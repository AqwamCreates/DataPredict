# Release Version 2.13

## Models

* Added these new options for "sigmoidFunction" in LogisticRegression's new() constructor:

  * HardSigmoid

  * SoftSign

  * Swish

  * ArcTangent

  * Swish

  * BipolarSigmoid

* All models now initialize ModelParameters when calling predict() function.

* All of the models' divergence warning is now only printed when "isPrintOutput" parameter is true in BaseModel's new() constructor.

* All models now print nan (not a number) value warning hen "isPrintOutput" parameter is true in BaseModel's new() constructor.

* Optimized KMedoids by reducing the amount of calculation needed to calculate the cost.

## Cores

* Added DistanceFunctionDictionary.

## Quick Setups

* Fixed a bug where calling reset() function from ReinforcementLearningBaseQuickSetup gives an error.

## All

* The error messages now screams at you less.
