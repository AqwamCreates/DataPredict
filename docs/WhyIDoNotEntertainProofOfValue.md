# Why I Do Not Entertain Proof Of Value

Alright everyone. Ever since DataPredict ecosystem product exploded, I have seen an increase in "proof of value" requests in my direct messages. 

Frankly, I really don't want to deal with such requests as they tend to eat up my development and contracting time despite the DataPredict ecosystem gives people value at plain sight.

Now, let's go over how the DataPredict ecosystem already provides value.

## No Huge Costs Or Development Time

When creating libraries that are similar to DataPredict, it generally requires more than 4 people that are already experience in the machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning fields.

Now, everyone knows that more experience means more higher salary. This can be made worse if you decide to build such libraries in-house as they can take more than a year to develop.

However, with DataPredict, I have removed a lot of unnecessary costs for you as the costs are mainly absorbed by me since I am quite passionate about machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning in general.

The passion of mines doesn't pay the bills though, so I should be charging on how much people rely on it.

Luckily for you, I have decided to go with volume-based approach where the licensing costs can be extremely low for you guys and is feasible due to me being a solo developer for the whole ecosystem.

As such, you can see the value from the monetary costs alone.

## 2% Revenue Only Applies When You Earn Revenue

The license is already generous enough, but I push this further where I'll only get paid only after your game that uses DataPredict earns revenue from it.

That means you are free to experiment as much as you want internally and you can perform A/B testing before fully commiting to the DataPredict ecosystem.

This was intentional given on how price-sensitive the game developers are and majority of the games do not earn that high revenue. As such, I do not wish to burden small game developers nor put them into bankruptcy.
