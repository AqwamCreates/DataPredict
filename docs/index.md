# Welcome to Aqwam's DataPredict™ Library!

This library was developed solo over more than 3 years (6000+ hours), which would exceed $300,000 USD in industry costs. Additionally, it requires near PhD-level knowledge to build and test all the models in this library. To all indie devs who just starting their business, feel free to use it without burning away your money!

By using or possessing any copies of this library or its assets (including the icons), you agree to our [Terms And Conditions](TermsAndConditions.md). In short:

* Public attribution is required when using this library.

* A separate agreement is needed for commercial use (both internally and externally). This applies to companies (or individuals, if none) whose combined revenue (including from subsidiaries or related entities) exceeds $3000 within 365 days (not per 365 days) or those engaged in business-to-business activities.

* If you or your company is applicable to the above statement and do not want a separate agreement, then you are required to follow the "Commercial Use Conditions" in Terms And Conditions.

* Plus some more stuff...

Once you pass this commercial use threshold and want to license it, keep this in mind:

* Expect to pay for (gross revenue * (0.0365 / log2(gross revenue))) every month, provided that it uses this library. In other words, it starts at around 1% of gross revenue and that percentage decreases as your project earns more. 

* Because machine, deep and reinforcement learning models try to find the best solution for you during training, you are likely (but not guaranteed) to increase your revenue over this cost.

* You're not licensing convenience; you're licensing a higher probability of increased revenue.

* Think of it this way: you’re not losing 1% of your revenue; you’re investing 1% to unlock the other 30% you might be leaving on the table. In some cases, the upside could be even higher.

* That fee also includes DataPredict™ Neural and DataPredict™ Axon. All the money will be used for future research and improvements that will be released to the public.

Thanks to the early adopters, I managed to to fund my Master research thesis (that may be published soon) on how to speed up reinforcement learning training by 10 times from the baseline methods. It is already implemented in the DataPredict™ and DataPredict™ Neural libraries!

DataPredict™ is a machine, deep and reinforcement learning library for Roblox and Pure Lua.

This project is created to address the lack of machine, deep and reinforcement learning libraries as well as the inflexibility of the available ones on Roblox. It is also a way for me to apply my machine, deep and reinforcement learning knowledge into its physical form.

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAZsynkede) server, [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/beta-mdll-machine-and-deep-learning-library-includes-optimizers-retrainable-models-and-more/2196446?u=myoriginsworkshop) thread or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).

In addition, if you are interested in Roblox tutorials and future projects by me, then you can subscribe to me in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUrwoxv5dufEmbGsxyEUPZw).

## Fun Facts About The DataPredict's Icon

The three blocks in the icons represents these meanings, which also show's the DataPredict's Library main design principles:

 * Basic: The icon uses simple blue blocks. This represents that the components of this library are very basic to use.

 * Stackable: The icon shows the blocks are stacking on each other. This represents the components in this library can be stacked over each other.

 * Portable: The three blocks can be unstacked and can move the individual blocks somewhere else. This represents how portable each of the components are when transfering from one system to another.

 Blue colour is chosen as it represents knowledge. This represents the data.

White octagon makes us focus on the blue blocks. This represent the focus on the components of this library.
