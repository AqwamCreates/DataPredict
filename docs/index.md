# Welcome to Aqwam's DataPredict™ Library!

> Torch7 lit the flame. DataPredict carries it forward.

> Machine Learning returns to Lua - for game engines.

> What once ended in deep learning returns as the full spectrum of machine learning.

You can find high-value project tutorials for improving retention and revenue [here](HighValueProjectTutorials.md)! You can also see how it reduces machine learning engineering costs [here](CostReductionInformation.md)

By using or possessing any copies of this library or its assets (including the icons), you agree to our [Terms And Conditions](TermsAndConditions.md).

This library was developed solo over more than 3 years (6000+ hours and includes weekends), which would exceed $300,000 USD in industry costs. Additionally, it requires near PhD-level knowledge to build and test all the models in this library. To all indie devs who just starting their business, feel free to use it without burning away your money!

* Because machine, deep and reinforcement learning models try to find the best solution for you during training, you are likely (but not guaranteed) to increase your revenue over this cost.

* You're not licensing convenience; you're licensing a higher probability of increased revenue.

* Think of it this way: you’re not losing 0.5%-5% of your revenue; you’re investing 0.5%-5% to unlock the other 30% you might be leaving on the table. In some cases, the upside could be even higher.

* That fee also includes DataPredict™ Neural and DataPredict™ Axon. All the money will be used for future research and improvements that will be released to the public.

Thanks to the early adopters, I managed to to fund my Master research thesis (that may be published soon) on how to speed up reinforcement learning training by 10 times from the baseline methods. It is already implemented in the DataPredict™ and DataPredict™ Neural libraries!

DataPredict™ is a machine, deep and reinforcement learning library for Roblox and Pure Lua.

This project is created to address the lack of machine, deep and reinforcement learning libraries as well as the inflexibility of the available ones on Roblox. It is also a way for me to apply my machine, deep and reinforcement learning knowledge into its physical form.

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAZsynkede) server, [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/beta-mdll-machine-and-deep-learning-library-includes-optimizers-retrainable-models-and-more/2196446?u=myoriginsworkshop) thread or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).

In addition, if you are interested in Roblox tutorials and future projects by me, then you can subscribe to me in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUrwoxv5dufEmbGsxyEUPZw).

To know what this library is all about from scratch, let's have a look at the quick introduction [here](QuickIntroduction.md).

## Fun Facts About The DataPredict's Icon

The three blocks in the icons represents these meanings, which also show's the DataPredict's Library main design principles:

 * Basic: The icon uses simple blue blocks. This represents that the components of this library are very basic to use.

 * Stackable: The icon shows the blocks are stacking on each other. This represents the components in this library can be stacked over each other.

 * Portable: The three blocks can be unstacked and can move the individual blocks somewhere else. This represents how portable each of the components are when transfering from one system to another.

 Blue colour is chosen as it represents knowledge. This represents the data.

White octagon makes us focus on the blue blocks. This represent the focus on the components of this library.
