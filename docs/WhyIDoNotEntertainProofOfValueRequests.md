# Why I Do Not Entertain "Proof Of Value" Requests

Alright everyone. Ever since DataPredict ecosystem product exploded, I have seen an increase in "proof of value" requests in my direct messages. 

Frankly, I do not want to deal with such requests. They tend to eat up my development for DataPredict and contracting time for my clients despite the DataPredict ecosystem shows obvious value.

Now, let's go over how the DataPredict ecosystem already provides value.

## No Huge Development Costs Or Time

When creating libraries that are similar to DataPredict, it generally requires more than 4 people that are already experience in the machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) fields.

Now, everyone knows that more experience means more higher salary. This can be made worse if you decide to build such libraries in-house as they can take more than a year to develop.

However, with DataPredict, I have removed a lot of unnecessary costs for you as I already absorbed the cost since I am quite passionate about ML, DL and RL in general.

The passion of mines doesn't pay the bills though, so I should be charging on how much people rely on it.

The DataPredict ecosystem took me 3 years to develop as a solo developer. I went borderline full time on it and even worked on it during weekends.

## Volume-Based Pricing

Instead of charging enterprise-level prices, I went for a volume-based model.

Because I’m a solo developer, I can afford to keep the licensing lightweight and scalable, where I use 2% revenue share that only kicks in when your game earns revenue. No upfront costs. No hidden fees. No per-seat charges.

That alone saves you:

* Development costs

* Hiring costs

* Time-to-market delays

And you get free support and a fully documented, production-ready ML, DL and RL stack for Roblox.

## Free Experimentation Without The Financial Commitment

You don’t need to take a gamble.

You can experiment freely and even run A/B tests using DataPredict in a separate, non-commercial test game before rolling it out into production. I’ve made this intentional because I know:

* Most games don’t earn massive revenue

* Game developers tend to be budget-conscious

Hence, I want the game developers to try out the DataPredict ecosystem without making them going bankrupt.

## Free Support

Given the amount of publicity that the DataPredict ecosystem has acquired, it is fair that people would be using this for research. As such, I would immediately handle all bug fixes and inquires relating to the DataPredict ecosystem for free.

Some platforms don't do this, so you will be getting extra value for free.

I prefer my DataPredict ecosystem to be production-grade and research-grade. Not toy libraries that doesn't scale. As such high quality will be mantained at all costs and at all times. This also includes catching up with the latest research and implement them into the DataPredict ecosystem.

## Value Is Also Dependent On How You Use It

Here’s the honest truth: Even the best tools won’t perform if you don’t know how to use them.

That includes Roblox Studio, Unity, Unreal, and even DataPredict.

If you misuse it, don’t expect 100% value. That’s not a “problem” with the tool — it’s a skill and application issue.

What I have delivered is a massive reduction in dev time, cost, and barrier to entry. Whether you turn that into revenue? That’s up to you.

## Conclusion

I have shown many ways on how the DataPredict ecosystem is already valuable in terms of:

* No huge development costs or time

* Volume-based pricing

* Free experimentation without the financial commitment

* Free support

* Value is also dependent on how you use it

If you’re still not convinced, DataPredict ecosystem probably isn’t for you. And that’s okay.

But if you see the opportunity? I’ve already done the hard part. All you need to do is build.
