> Guess Less, Keep Players, Grow Your Game, Forget Competitors! 

> Make Games That Adapts To Players, Not The Other Way Around!

> And Keep The Source Of Retention And Revenue Out Of Competitors' Sight!

## Disclaimer

* The "minimal implementation time" assumes that a junior gameplay machine learning engineer is handling the implementation.

* Since DataPredict is written in native Lua, you can have extra compute per player alongside a single Roblox server by loading the models on players' Roblox client.

  * Phone users: Likely have 4 GB - 8 GB RAM. Variable CPU.
 
  * PC users: Likely have 8 GB - 16 GB RAM. Variable CPU.

## Preparation

* [Production Deployment And Consulting](ProductionDeploymentAndConsulting.md) (Optional)

  * For studios that require additional assurance when deploying machine learning systems in live projects, I provide optional consulting support for DataPredict-based integrations.

* [Safe Practices For Integrating Model In Live Project](HighValueProjectTutorials/SafePracticesForLiveProjects.md)

* [Tips For Online Training With Limited Dataset](HighValueProjectTutorials/TipsForOnlineTrainingWithLimitedDataset.md)

* [Game Design Meets Machine Learning](HighValueProjectTutorials/GameDesignMeetsMachineLearning.md) (Incomplete)

* [Roblox's Experiment API](https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/experiments)

  * For A/B testing when deploying machine learning systems in live projects to measure its impact.
