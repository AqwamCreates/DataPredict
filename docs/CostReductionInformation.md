## Cost Reduction Factors

| Cost Reduction Factor | Without DataPredict                                                                                                                               | With DataPredict                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Expertise             | Requires Hiring Of A Machine Learning Engineer, Starting At 5K USD Per Month To Build Optimized Models Required By Your Projects. Preferrably Holding A PhD Or Masters Degree To Ensure Correctness. | Can Use Existing Game Developers. Can Learn From DataPredict's High-Value Project Tutorials To Specialize Further.     |
| Integration           | Additional Costs From Hosting External Servers And Connecting ML Frameworks In Different Programming Languages. | Lua Only. |
| Compute Cost          | If Models Are Hosted Externally, Compute Cost Increases As Number Of Players Increases. | Utilize Roblox Servers' And Players' CPUs At No Additional Cost. |
| Choosing Models       | Need To Learn Multiple ML Frameworks For Machine Learning, Deep Learning And Reinforcement Learning In Different Programming Languages If Models Are Hosted Externally.  | Unified Under Same API Design. All Models With High-Value Use Cases Are Covered. |
| Time-To-Market        | Requires Multi-Year Engineering For The Whole Library If Building From Scratch. Minimum Of 1 Week If Using Existing ML Frameworks Hosted In Different Programming Languages. | Within A Day.
| Latency               | Network Latency And Serialization Issues If Hosted Externally. | Latency Only Comes From Models' Training And Predictions. |
| Security              | If Hosted Externally, Vulnerable To Hacking.                   | Data Stays Between The Servers And Clients.               |
| Reliability           | May Be Inaccurate Or Underperform When Building From Scratch.  | Built Over 3 Years With Game Domain Specialty. |
| Legal                 | If Hosted Externally, Requires Active Compliance For Data Protection Laws. | Data Stays Between The Servers And Clients. As A Result, Mostly Complies With Data Protection laws. |

## Licensing Costs

| License Type Based On Gross Revenue Per Company / Group / Individual      | Percentage To Pay Based On Project's Gross Revenue In USD | Additional Notes                          | Licensing Cost When A Project Earns 10K / 100K / 1M USD Per Month |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Non-B2B + Less Than Or Equal To 3K USD Within 365 Days (Not Per 365 Days) | 0%                                                        | Requires Public Disclosure Of DataPredict | Not Applicable        |
| Standard                                                                  | 2% That Decreases As Gross Revenue Increases              | Requires Public Disclosure Of DataPredict | 160 USD / 1300 USD / 10,530 USD |
| White-Label                                                               | 5%                                                        | None                                      | 500 USD / 5000 USD / 50,000 USD |

## Development Costs

The table assumes that only one person is working on each library at machine learning engineer average salary rate.

| Library             | Time Cost               | Monetary Cost (USD) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| DataPredict™        | 25000+ Hours (~3 Years) | 300,000             |
| DataPredict™ Neural | 17000+ Hours (~2 Years) | 200,000             |
| DataPredict™ Axon   | 4000+ Hours (~6 Months) | 50,000              |
| All                 | 43800+ Hours (~5 Years) | 550,000             |
