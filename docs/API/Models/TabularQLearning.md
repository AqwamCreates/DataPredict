# [API Reference](../../API.md) - [Models](../Models.md) - TabularQLearning (Tabular Q Learning)

TabularQLearning is a state-action grid with reinforcement learning capabilities. It can predict any positive numbers of discrete values.

## Constructors

### new()

Create new model object. If any of the arguments are nil, default argument values for that argument will be used.

```
TabularQLearning.new(lambda: number, discountFactor: number): ModelObject
```

#### Parameters:

* lambda: At 0, the model acts like the Temporal Difference algorithm. At 1, the model acts as Monte Carlo algorithm. Between 0 and 1, the model acts as both. [Default: 0]

* discountFactor: The higher the value, the more likely it focuses on long-term outcomes. The value must be set between 0 and 1. [Default: 0.95]

#### Returns:

* ModelObject: The generated model object.
