## Why Not Open-Source?

Currently, the library is built solo by me (Aqwam) for three years straight (including weekends), making it 6000+ hours worth of work of total.

However, the passion of mines don't pay the bills, so I needed to monetize this and avoid exploitation from large companies.

That being said, I'm quite aware that most small developers don't have enough money to generate from their games, hence I allow a limited commercial use for them.

This source-available (not open source) philosophy would then also extend to the contributors, who would also be exploited by large companies if we were to take the open-source path.

## Why Contribute To This Source-Available DataPredict™ Ecosystem?

I get it. You don't want me to exploit your free labour as well. So, let me propose a deal with you.

If you somehow managed to contribute at least 10% to the DataPredict™ ecosystem, I will give you employment and startup leverage.

All you need to do is contact your employer (or your other leaders if you own the organization) to get three DataPredict license that halves the monthly licensing costs. These are valid as long as you are employed in that organization.

* If you are employed under a organization, these licenses are non-transferrable.

* If you own the organization, these licenses are transferrable between internal projects.

I think it is pretty clear right now on how much leverage you will have compared to contributing an open-source project.

Want a higher salary for your next job? Use this as a negotiation point.

Want to raise startup funding? Use this as a differentiation point.

Compared to open-source where everyone can just exploit your work for free, source-available gives you the reward for your hard-work by restricting others from commercial use except for you.

And you know what's better? If your employer or other leaders doesn't treat you fairly and their projects relies on these free licenses, you can walk out of that organization and impact them legally (due to license revocation if you leave the company). We call that "leverage".

## What's the catch?

You can only offer these licenses to the first organization (that is eligible using DataPredict™ Ecosystem) if you are employed in multiple organizations. I don't like being exploited either, so there's that.

Additionally, all the code you write will have their copyright assigned to me directly. So, you would lose control there, but I doubt anyone would complain if I already had given you a strong leverage for your career progression.

The employer or you will also need to show the DataPredict™ attribution to the public in their projects when using this license.

If you're okay with this, then you can sign the contribution licensing agreement [here]().
