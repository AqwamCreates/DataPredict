# Recommendation Systems

## Regression Recommendation Systems

* [Creating Probability-Based Recommendation Model](RecommendationSystems/CreatingProbabilityBasedRecommendationModel.md)

  * Minimal implementation takes a minimum of 2 hours using DataPredict™.

* [Creating Similarity-Based Recommendation Model](RecommendationSystems/CreatingSimilarityBasedRecommendationModel.md)

  * Memory-based model. May eat up storage space.

  * Minimal implementation takes a minimum of 2 hours using DataPredict™.

* [Creating Reward-Maximization-Based Regression Recommendation Model](RecommendationSystems/CreatingRewardMaximizationBasedRegressionRecommendationModel.md)

  * Limited to one recommendation at a time.

  * Have higher monetization potential due to its ability to exploit and explore than the other two models, but tend to be risky to use.

  * Minimal implementation takes a minimum of 2 hours using DataPredict™, especially if multiple recommendations are made.

* [Creating Reward-Maximization-Based Regression Recommendation Model (Aqwam's Style)](CreatingRewardMaximizationBasedRegressionRecommendationModelAqwamStyle.md)

  * Similar to the previous model.

  * Faster convergence due to taking advantage of the probabilistic nature of input values.

  * Minimal implementation takes a minimum of 2 hours using DataPredict™, especially if multiple recommendations are made.

## Binary Recommendation Systems

* [Creating Classification-Based Recommendation Model](RecommendationSystems/CreatingClassificationBasedRecommendationModel.md)

  * Minimal implementation takes a minimum of 2 hours using DataPredict™.

* [Creating Reward-Maximization-Based Binary Recommendation Model](RecommendationSystems/CreatingRewardMaximizationBasedBinaryRecommendationModel.md)

  * Limited to one recommendation at a time.

  * Have higher monetization potential due to its ability to exploit and explore than the classification-based model, but tend to be risky to use.

  * Minimal implementation takes a minimum of 2 hours using DataPredict™, especially if multiple recommendations are made.
