* References that validates the use cases can be found [here](HighValueProjectTutorials/References.md). It also includes my papers.

* The "minimal implementation time" assumes that a junior gameplay machine learning engineer is handling the implementation.

* Since DataPredict is written in native Lua, you can have extra compute per player alongside a single Roblox server by loading the models on players' Roblox client.

  * Phone users: Likely have 4 GB - 8 GB RAM. Variable CPU.
 
  * PC users: Likely have 8 GB - 16 GB RAM. Variable CPU.

* Before you engage in integrating machine, deep and reinforcement learning models into live projects, I recommend you to have a look at safe practices [here](HighValueProjectTutorials/SafePracticesForLiveProjects.md).
