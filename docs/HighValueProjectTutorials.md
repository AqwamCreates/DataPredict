## Recommendation Systems

* Creating Similarity-Based Recommendation System

* Creating Reward-Maximization-Based Recommendation System

* Creating Classification-Based Recommendation System

## Adaptive Difficulty Systems

* Creating Success-Based Adaptive Difficulty System

  * Encodes positive label for every successful kills and associate it with current enemy's data.

* Creating Reward-Maximization-Based Adaptive Difficulty System

  * Everytime an enemy is killed, the positive reward tells the model to "make more like this". 

  * If the player ignores or doesn't kill the enemy, the negative reward tells the model that "not interesting to the player" or "this is too hard for the player to kill".

* Creating Cluster-Based Difficulty Difficulty System

  * Uses players' data to generate the best enemies' data.
