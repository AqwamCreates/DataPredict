# Stress Systems

## Disclaimer

* While stress is hard to measure through biological means, the resulting behaviour from stress can be measured based on:

  * Accuracy - The more stressed you are, the more harder it is for you to focus.

  * Erratic Control - The more stressed you are, the more harder it is for you to focus.

## Stress Tracking Models

* [Creating Erratic Tracking Model](StressSystems/CreatingErraticTrackingModel.md)

    * Uses Kalman Filter to use cost as "erratic" score.

## Stress Detection Models



## Stress Minimization Models

* [Creating Stress Minimization Model](StressSystems/CreatingStressMinimizationModel.md)

    * Uses diagonal gaussian deep reinforcement learning to minimize the stress score.
 
    * The stress score can be used as rewards.
