# Placement Systems

* [Creating Probability-Based Clustering Placement Model](HighValueProjectTutorials/CreatingProbabilityBasedClusteringPlacementModel.md)

  * Identifies areas of low player / item densities for spawning players / items.

  * Extremely overkill, but my head doesn't want to let it go. So, feel free to use it as an "inspiration", I guess.

  * Minimal implementation takes a minimum of 30 minutes using DataPredictâ„¢.
