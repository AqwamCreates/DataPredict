# Why I Do Not Entertain Proof Of Value

Alright everyone. Ever since DataPredict ecosystem product exploded, I have seen an increase in "proof of value" requests in my direct messages. 

Frankly, I really don't want to deal with such requests as they tend to eat up my development and contracting time despite the DataPredict ecosystem gives people value at plain sight.

Now, let's go over how the DataPredict ecosystem already provides value.

## No Huge Development Costs Or Time

When creating libraries that are similar to DataPredict, it generally requires more than 4 people that are already experience in the machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) fields.

Now, everyone knows that more experience means more higher salary. This can be made worse if you decide to build such libraries in-house as they can take more than a year to develop.

However, with DataPredict, I have removed a lot of unnecessary costs for you as I already absorbed the cost since I am quite passionate about ML, DL and RL in general.

The passion of mines doesn't pay the bills though, so I should be charging on how much people rely on it.

## Volume-Based Pricing

Instead of charging enterprise-level prices, I went for a volume-based model.

Because I’m a solo developer, I can afford to keep the licensing lightweight and scalable, where I use 2% revenue share that only kicks in when your game earns revenue. No upfront costs. No hidden fees. No per-seat charges.

That alone saves you:

* Development costs

* Hiring costs

* Time-to-market delays

And you get free support and a fully documented, production-ready ML, DL and RL stack for Roblox.

## Free Experimentation Without Financial Commitment

You don’t need to take a gamble.

You can experiment freely and even run A/B tests using DataPredict in a separate, non-commercial test game before rolling it out into production. I’ve made this intentional because I know:

* Most games don’t earn massive revenue

* Game developers tend to be budget-conscious

Hence, I want the game developers to try out the DataPredict ecosystem without making them going bankrupt.

## Conclusion

I have shown many ways on how the DataPredict ecosystem is already valuable in terms of:

* No huge development costs or time

* Volume-based pricing

* Free experimentation without financial commitment

If you’re still not convinced, DataPredict ecosystem probably isn’t for you. And that’s okay.

But if you see the opportunity? I’ve already done the hard part. All you need to do is build.
