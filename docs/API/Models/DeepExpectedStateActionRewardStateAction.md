# [API Reference](../../API.md) - [Models](../Models.md) - DeepExpectedStateActionRewardStateAction (Deep Expected SARSA)

DeepExpectedStateActionRewardStateAction is a neural network with reinforcement learning capabilities. It can predict any positive numbers of discrete values.

## Constructors

### new()

Create new model object. If any of the arguments are nil, default argument values for that argument will be used.

```
DeepExpectedStateActionRewardStateAction.new(epsilon: number, discountFactor: number): ModelObject
```

#### Parameters:

* epsilon: Controls the balance between exploration and exploitation for calculating expected Q-values. The value must be set between 0 and 1. The value 0 focuses on exploitation only and 1 focuses on exploration only. [Default: 0.5]

* lambda: At 0, the model acts like the Temporal Difference algorithm. At 1, the model acts as Monte Carlo algorithm. Between 0 and 1, the model acts as both. [Default: 0]

* discountFactor: The higher the value, the more likely it focuses on long-term outcomes. The value must be set between 0 and 1. [Default: 0.95]

#### Returns:

* ModelObject: The generated model object.
