| 🔰   | Beginner Algorithm         | Commonly taught to beginners.          |
| 🔵   | Data Efficient             | Require few data to train the model.   |
| 🟣   | Noise Resistant            | Can handle randomness / unclean data.  |
| 🟢   | Online                     | Can adapt real-time.                   |
| 🟡   | Session-Adaptive / Offline | Can be retrained each session.         |
| 🔴   | Assumption-Heavy           | Assumes linear / independent features. |

### Note

* For strong deep learning applications, have a look at [DataPredict™ Neural](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict-Neural) (object-oriented) and [DataPredict™ Axon](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict-Axon) (function-oriented) instead. DataPredict™ is only suitable for general purpose machine, deep and reinforcement learning.

  * Contains most of the deep reinforcement learning and generative algorithms listed here.

  * Includes convolutional, pooling, embedding, dropout and activation layers.

  * Uses reverse-mode automatic differentiation and lazy differentiation evaluation for DataPredict™ Neural (static graph) and DataPredict™ Axon (dynamic graph).

* Currently, DataPredict™ has ~90% (56 out of 65) models with online learning capabilities. By default, most models would perform offline / batch training on the first train, but then switches to online / incremental / sequential after the first train.

* Tabular reinforcement learning models can use optimizers. And yes, I am quite aware that I have overengineered this, but I really want to make this a grand finale before I stop updating DataPredict™ for a long time.

* No dimensionality reduction algorithms due to not being suitable for game-related use cases. They tend to be computationally expensive and are only useful when a full dataset is collected. This can be offset by choosing proper features and remove the unnecessary ones.

* Going "Gold" on my birthday at 23 January 2026. Probably.

\* The "instant train" models assumes that the features have a linear relationship with the label values, which is almost certainly not true in game-related settings.

 * To use these models, your feature matrix need to be the shape of (n x n).

 * It also recommended to add small independent noise values to each features.
