# Terms And Conditions Violation Bounty Reward Information

## License Violation Reporting And Bounty Rewards

If you suspect that any license violations, including those involving your own company/group, have occurred, you may be eligible for a bounty reward of up to 50% of the value of the violating company/group, subject to the following terms:

* Eligible Violations:
  
  * Violations that would qualify for a bounty include, but are not limited to, failure to release code that interacts with the Library in accordance with the terms of the License.
  
  * The violation must be a clear breach of the license, such as not publicly releasing interacting code when required by the License or failing to adhere to the proper usage conditions outlined within the License.

* Reporting Process:
  
  * If you suspect a violation, please contact the Licensor directly for confirmation rather than relying solely on the statements of the company or group involved. This will ensure the claim is properly assessed and avoids unnecessary confusion or potential misinformation.
  
  * A detailed report with evidence of the violation must be provided to substantiate your claim. This may include documentation, links, or any other relevant proof that supports the assertion of a violation.

* Bounty Reward Calculation:
  
  * The bounty reward will be based on the severity of the violation, the ease of prosecution, and the level of involvement of the individual(s) or team responsible for the violation.
  
  * The reward will not necessarily reflect the full financial impact or value of the violating company/group but will be a percentage of the value associated with the violation.
  
  * The maximum bounty reward is 50% of the value of the violating company/group. The actual reward may be lower depending on the specifics of the case, such as the complexity of the violation, the difficulty in proving it, and the overall damages incurred.

* Guidelines for Evaluation:
  
  * Severity of the Violation: This is assessed based on how serious the breach is in relation to the terms of the license. For example, willfully ignoring the release of interacting code or failing to properly attribute the library might warrant a higher reward compared to more minor violations.
  
  * Evidence Strength: The bounty is only applicable if you provide clear, substantial evidence of the violation. A mere suspicion without solid proof may not qualify for a bounty.
  
  * Ease of Prosecution: If the violation is straightforward and can be easily proven, a larger portion of the maximum bounty may be awarded. If the case is complex, involves multiple parties, or lacks clear evidence, the reward may be smaller or not applicable.

* Level of Responsibility:
  
  * Higher-Level Decision Makers: If the violation is traced back to individuals in higher positions (such as CEO, CFO, CTO, Project Manager, etc.), the violation is considered to be more systematic or institutional in nature. This could indicate that the violation was part of the organization's strategy or internal decision-making.
    
    * Reward Increase Based on Role: A violation involving higher-level management or executives will increase the bounty reward due to the systemic nature of the breach. The involvement of a senior leader may indicate that the violation was planned or approved at an organizational level.
    
    * For example:
      
      * CEO / Executive Level: Highest bounty reward due to the potential for widespread, organizational-level violations (up to 50% of the value).
      
      * Project Manager / Senior Developer: Lower reward, but still significant depending on the evidence of the violation (e.g., 25-30% of the value).
  
  * Lower-Level Employees: If the violation is traced back to a lower-level employee or is seen as an isolated mistake, the reward may be lower (e.g., 10-15% of the value) based on the fact that the violation was not part of a larger, coordinated action by higher management. However, if the violation is notified to the higher level decision makers by the Licensor and these violations are not addressed by them, then it will be counted as a violation made by the higher-level decision makers.

* Protection from Personal Liability:
  
  * The reward system is intended to protect individuals from personal liability in cases of license violations. Violations will typically be pursued against the company/group, not individuals, unless the individual is directly responsible for the breach.
  
  * If an individual within a company/group is unaware of the violation and reports it accurately, they are still eligible for the reward, but personal liability will not be imposed on them for simply reporting the issue.

## False Accusations, Defamation And Criminal Liability

* Any individual or entity making false accusations or engaging in defamation against a company/group or individual under this License will be subject to criminal prosecution under applicable criminal law, including but not limited to laws surrounding defamation, libel, and slander.

* If it is determined that a violation report was made with malicious intent, fabrication, or false information, the reporting party may face criminal penalties, including fines or imprisonment, as prescribed by the relevant laws.

* Penalties for defamation or false accusations can include, but are not limited to:
  
  * Compensatory damages to the accused party for harm caused by the false accusations or defamation.
  
  * Reputational damage penalties, which may include fines or legal action to rectify the harm caused to the reputation of the accused company or individual.
  
  * Legal costs: The costs of defending against a false accusation, including legal fees, court costs, and any other related expenses.
  
  * Compensatory damages: The company or individual defamed may seek compensation for emotional distress, harm to reputation, and any tangible financial losses suffered due to the false accusation.

The individual responsible for the false accusation or defamation will be required to pay compensatory damages, and the Licensor reserves the right to pursue legal action for damages resulting from a false report or malicious defamation.

## Damages As A Result Of False Accusations Or Defamation

* If a company or group is wrongfully accused or defamed due to a false report or malicious claim, the individual responsible for the false accusation will be liable for the damages incurred, including but not limited to:
  
  * Loss of business: Any revenue lost as a direct result of the false accusation or defamation.
  
  * Reputational damage: Costs associated with repairing the company's or individualâ€™s reputation, including legal and public relations costs.
  
  * Legal costs: The costs of defending against a false accusation, including legal fees, court costs, and any other related expenses.
  
  * Compensatory damages: The company or individual defamed may seek compensation for emotional distress, harm to reputation, and any tangible financial losses suffered due to the false accusation.

The individual responsible for the false accusation or defamation will be required to pay compensatory damages, and the Licensor reserves the right to pursue legal action for damages resulting from a false report or malicious defamation.

## Exclusions And Terms For False Claims

* No Rewards for False Claims: If it is determined that the violation was fabricated, misleading, or not substantiated by evidence, no reward will be given, and the reporting individual may face legal consequences, including criminal prosecution for defamation or false accusations.

* Bounty Restrictions: Any reward for reporting a violation is contingent upon the truthfulness and validity of the accusation. If the report is determined to be false or misleading, the individual will forfeit any claim to the reward and may be legally liable for any damages caused by the false claim.

## Summary

* Maximum reward: Up to 50% of the value of the violating company/group.

* Eligibility: Only violations that clearly breach the license and are accompanied by strong evidence will qualify.

* Reporting process: Report directly to the Licensor with documentation; do not rely on company statements alone.

* Reward based on severity, evidence, ease of prosecution, and the level of involvement of decision-makers.
  
  * Higher-level violations (e.g., CEO or executive involvement) will result in higher rewards.
  
  * Lower-level violations (e.g., individual employee actions) will result in lower rewards.

* Criminal liability for false accusations or defamation, with penalties including fines, legal costs, and compensatory damages for the harmed parties.

* Damages for false accusations: Any company or individual falsely accused will be entitled to compensation for damages from the reporting individuals, including reputational harm, business losses, and legal fees.

## Example

If a CEO of Company X approves the decision to use the library commercially without releasing the interacting code, and someone reports this violation with sufficient evidence, the person reporting the violation could receive a larger bounty reward (up to 50% of the company's value), given the systemic nature of the violation at the executive level.

Conversely, if a project manager or developer fails to release the interacting code but it is seen as an isolated error rather than a systemic decision, the reward would be smaller (around 25-30%) based on the role and responsibility involved.
