# DataPredict Libraries Commercial Licensing Agreements

### Disclaimer

* I do not entertain "proof of value" requests. You can read the reasons [here](WhyIDoNotEntertainProofOfValueRequests.md).

* I do not negotiate for the purchase of the whole DataPredict ecosystem. However, I am open for partnerships for game ML consultation businesses where:

   * If your client has already paid extra 500 USD (to remove 3-months cool-off) on top of these license, then you may consult with your clients without additional cost.
 
      * This is to avoid a loophole where clients can just get 2% only from me and then skip 500 USD charge by immediately consulting you without my awareness.
  
   * Otherwise, you bear the 500 USD upfront cost.
 
   * The 500 USD upfront cost would begin on March-April.

* For information regarding potential license violations and eligibility for a bounty reward, please refer to the [Terms And Conditions Violation Bounty Reward Information](TermsAndConditionsViolationBountyRewardInformation.md).
