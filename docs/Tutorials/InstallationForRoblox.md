# Getting Started

In this library, we can customize many of our models, optimizers and others to fit our needs. This was made possible thanks to the object-orientated design of our library.

To start, we must first link our machine/deep learning library with our matrix library. However, you must use "Aqwam's 2D Tensor Library" as every calculations made by our models are based on that tensor library.

You can read the Terms And Conditions for the TensorL2D Library [here](https://github.com/AqwamCreates/TensorL-2D/blob/main/docs/TermsAndConditions.md).

To download the files from GitHub, you must click on the download button highlighted in the red box.

Then drag the files into Roblox Studio from a file explorer of your choice.

Once you put those two libraries into your game, make sure you link the DataPredict Library with the TensorL-2D Library. This can be done via setting the “AqwamTensorLibraryLinker” value (under the DataPredict) to the TensorL-2D Library.

Next, we will use require() function to our machine/deep learning library:

```lua
local DataPredict = require(AqwamMachineAndDeepLearningLibrary) 
```
