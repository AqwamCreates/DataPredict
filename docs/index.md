DataPredict™ is a machine, deep and reinforcement learning library for Roblox and Pure Lua.

This project is created to address the lack of machine, deep and reinforcement learning libraries as well as the inflexibility of the available ones on Roblox. It is also a way for me to apply my machine, deep and reinforcement learning knowledge into its physical form.

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAZsynkede) server, [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/beta-mdll-machine-and-deep-learning-library-includes-optimizers-retrainable-models-and-more/2196446?u=myoriginsworkshop) thread or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).

In addition, if you are interested in Roblox tutorials and future projects by me, then you can subscribe to me in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUrwoxv5dufEmbGsxyEUPZw).
