# [API Reference](../../API.md) - [Models](../Models.md) - DeepDoubleExpectedStateActionRewardStateActionV2 (Double Deep Expected SARSA)

DeepDoubleExpectedStateActionRewardStateActionV2 is a neural network with reinforcement learning capabilities. It can predict any positive numbers of discrete values. 

## Constructors

### new()

Create new model object. If any of the arguments are nil, default argument values for that argument will be used.

```
DeepDoubleExpectedStateActionRewardStateAction.new(epsilon: number, averagingRate: number, discountFactor: number): ModelObject
```

#### Parameters:

* epsilon: Controls the balance between exploration and exploitation for calculating expected Q-values. The value must be set between 0 and 1. The value 0 focuses on exploitation only and 1 focuses on exploration only.

* averagingRate: The higher the value, the faster the weights changes. The value must be set between 0 and 1.

* discountFactor: The higher the value, the more likely it focuses on long-term outcomes. The value must be set between 0 and 1.

#### Returns:

* ModelObject: The generated model object.

## Functions

### setParameters()

Set model's parameters. When any of the arguments are nil, previous argument values for that argument will be used.

```
DeepDoubleExpectedStateActionRewardStateAction:setParameters(epsilon: number, averagingRate: number, discountFactor: number)
```

#### Parameters:

* epsilon: Controls the balance between exploration and exploitation for calculating expected Q-values. The value must be set between 0 and 1. The value 0 focuses on exploitation only and 1 focuses on exploration only.

* averagingRate: The higher the value, the faster the weights changes. The value must be set between 0 and 1.

* discountFactor: The higher the value, the more likely it focuses on long-term outcomes. The value must be set between 0 and 1.
