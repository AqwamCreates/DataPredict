| Time-To-Leave Prediction Model        | Play Time Maximization Model |
| Probability-To-Leave Prediction Model |                              |

* Should the probability-to-leave be greater than 50%, the time-to-leave value will be used to observe on how long the play time maximization model should wait before collecting its rewards and update it.
