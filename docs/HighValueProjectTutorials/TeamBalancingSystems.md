# Team Balancing Systems

* [Creating Cluster-Based Team Balancing Model](TeamBalancingSystems/CreatingClusterBasedTeamBalancingModel.md)

  * Minimal implementation takes a minimum of 30 minutes using DataPredictâ„¢.

* [Creating Classification-Based Team Balancing Model](TeamBalancingSystems/CreatingClassificationBasedTeamBalancingModel.md) (Incomplete)

  * Uses two-player combat data pairs (player + ally or player + enemy) to determine player's win rate.

  * Due to combat data pair nature for this model, it likely lead to combinatorial explosion.
