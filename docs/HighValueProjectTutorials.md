* The "minimal implementation time" assumes that a junior gameplay machine learning engineer is handling the implementation.

* Since DataPredict is written in native Lua, you can have extra compute per player alongside a single Roblox server by loading the models on players' Roblox client.

  * Phone users: Likely have 4 GB - 8 GB RAM. Variable CPU.

  * Might be the most terrible idea out of this list. However, I will not stop game designers from making their games look "smart".

    * The model will likely do a lot of exploration before it can hit a single player. Once that particular location is marked as "reward location", the model will might overfocus on it.

  * The only difference is that you give counter attacks to players' potential attacks.
