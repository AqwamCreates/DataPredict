  * ArcTangent

  * Swish

  * BipolarSigmoid

* Added DistanceFunctionDictionary under the "Cores" section.

## Changes

* All models now initialize ModelParameters when calling predict() function under "Models" section.

* Optimized KMedoids by reducing the amount of calculation needed to calculate the cost under "Models" section.

* All of the models' divergence warning is now only printed when "isPrintOutput" parameter is true in BaseModel's new() constructor under "Models" section.

* All models now print nan (not a number) value warning hen "isPrintOutput" parameter is true in BaseModel's new() constructor under "Models" section.
