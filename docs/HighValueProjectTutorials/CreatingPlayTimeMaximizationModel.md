# Creating Play Time Maximization Model

For this tutorial, we need multiple things to build our model, this includes:

* Neural Network Model

* A Reinforcement Learning Model (Deep Q Learning or Deep SARSA)

* Categorical Policy Quick Setup

## Constructing Our Model

Before we start collecting our data, we first build our model so it will not be confusing later on.
