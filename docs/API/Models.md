### Note

* For strong deep learning applications, have a look at [DataPredict™ Neural](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict-Neural) (object-oriented) and [DataPredict™ Axon](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict-Axon) (function-oriented) instead. DataPredict™ is only suitable for general purpose machine, deep and reinforcement learning.

  * Contains most of the deep reinforcement learning and generative algorithms listed here.

  * Includes convolutional, pooling, embedding, dropout and activation layers.

  * Uses reverse-mode automatic differentiation and lazy differentiation evaluation for DataPredict™ Neural (static graph) and DataPredict™ Axon (dynamic graph).

* Currently, DataPredict™ has ~90% (61 out of 70) models with online learning capabilities. By default, most models would perform offline / batch training on the first train, but then switches to online / incremental / sequential after the first train.

* Tabular reinforcement learning models can use optimizers. And yes, I am quite aware that I have overengineered this, but I really want to make this a grand finale before I stop updating DataPredict™ for a long time.

* No dimensionality reduction algorithms due to not being suitable for game-related use cases. They tend to be computationally expensive and are only useful when a full dataset is collected. This can be offset by choosing proper features and remove the unnecessary ones.

* Going "Gold" on my birthday at 23 January 2026. Probably.

\* The "instant train" models have these issues:

 * It assumes that the features have a linear relationship with the label values, which is almost certainly not true in game-related settings. Hence, it is recommended to add small independent noise values to each features.

 * The feature matrix will also need to have shape of (n x n). This naturally leads to the requirement of label vector with a shape of (n x 1).
