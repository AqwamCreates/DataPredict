* Investigating The Performance Of Model-Free Deep Reinforcement Learning In Roblox Ecosystem (Master Research Thesis) (Thesis done. Translation to Malay is needed to meet my university's requirements.)

* Impact Of Lua-Native Machine Learning Retention Models On Metaverse Experiences On Roblox Ecosystem (Research Paper) (Secondary Priority)

  * Covers revenue, play time and player-returning-power.

  * Anonymized data to protect my clients' interests.

  * Not really my idea, but my clients recommend me to do it so that they have a "scientific paper" to pitch to their clients. Might take a while since I am focused on taking care of my brother plus my master research thesis.

* DataPredict: A General Machine, Deep, Reinforcement Learning Library For Lua-Native Games (Research Paper) (Secondary Priority)

  * Again, not really my idea, but the researchers using DataPredict recommend me to do it to make it easy to cite to their papers. Same slow progress reasoning as above.

## Recommendation System

Note: It is tough to find game-related recommendation systems. However, I still used them to understand data collection and what item attributes to use when recommending an item.
