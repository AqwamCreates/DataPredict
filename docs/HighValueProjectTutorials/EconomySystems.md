# Economy Systems

* Willingness-to-Pay Prediction. (Use BayesianLinearRegression)

* Dynamic Pricing For In-Game Currencies (Use TD Actor-Critic + Diagonal Gaussian Policy + Tanh activation outputs to multiply with base cost and then add with the base cost to get new effective cost.)

* Virtual Currency Velocity (Use KalmanFilter)

* Transaction Prediction (Use Markov).

  * Predict next purchase type / timing.
